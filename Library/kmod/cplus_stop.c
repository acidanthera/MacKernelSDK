/*
 *   Subtle combination of files and libraries make up the C++ runtime system for kernel modules.  We are dependant on the KernelModule kmod.make and CreateKModInfo.perl scripts to be exactly instep with both this library module and the libkmod module as well.
 *
 *   If you do any maintenance on any of the following files make sure great care is taken to keep them in Sync.
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmod.make
 *   KernelModule.bproj/CreateKModInfo.perl
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmodc++/pure.c
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmodc++/cplus_start.c
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmodc++/cplus_start.c
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmodc/c_start.c
 *   KernelModule.bproj/kmodc/c_stop.c
 *
 *   The trick is that the linkline links all of the developers modules.  If any static constructors are used .constructors_used will be left as an undefined symbol.  This symbol is exported by the cplus_start.c routine which automatically brings in the appropriate C++ _start routine.  However the actual _start symbol is only required by the kmod_info structure that is created and initialized by the CreateKModInfo.perl script.  If no C++ was used the _start will be an undefined symbol that is finally satisfied by the c_start module in the kmod library.
 *
 *   The linkline must look like this.
 *.o -lkmodc++ kmod_info.o -lkmod
